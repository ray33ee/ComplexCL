To Do list:

 - Get error codes from OpenCL api calls and act accordingly
 - Create readme.md with build instructions
 - Figure out why some executions take longer than others (check elapsed times)
 - Figure out why '-(0)' throws error
 - Make sure dialog widgets scale with dialog
 - Add/finish newton raphson root finding
 - Add prioritise speed functionality
 - Find out why this canvas drawing takes longer when maximised
    - If you compare the time elapsed when maximised vs not maximised (but still approximately the same size) there is a clear issue
 - Use multithreading if OpenCL is not availabl
 - For when OpenCL is working, launch OpenCL kernel in worker thread so as not to block UI
 - If there are critical errors with OpenCL, do we exit or change to host multithreading?
 - Add extra information to status bar
